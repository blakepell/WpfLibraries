# WPF Libraries

The project includes a collection legacy WPF libraries that have been converted to target the latest versions of .NET Core.  When possible the demo projects associated with those projects will also be included.

## Libaries

- [MvvmFoundation.Wpf](docs/MvvmFoundation.Wpf.md) : Simple MVVM Library for WPF
- [Thriple](docs/Thriple.md) : 3D Control Library
- [Transitionals](docs/Transitionals.md) : Transition Animations between visual controls.

## Supported Targets

These libraries have been updated to support the latest .NET Core targets.  When possible, legacy target frameworks are also left to allow for the widest range of usage from whatever target you're using, whether it be a .NET Framework 3.5 app from 2007 or a .NET 7 app from 2023.  In general this is the base set of targets I'm compiling the Nuget packages for.

 - .NET 7.0
 - .NET 6.0
 - .NET Framework 4.8
 - .NET Framework 4.6.2
 - .NET Framework 3.5
